          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Numerous studies show that the generation and use of Big data has arrived in businesses and is of great relevance to most respondents. Nevertheless, many potentials remain untapped. According to the BearingPoint study, cross-divisional data analysis is rarely used. The resulting data silos and lack of exchange make analysis difficult in many areas. The lack of internal knowledge also prevents many companies from developing in the field of analysis of large amounts of data.</p>

          <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=6 data-line-end=7 ><a id="Uber_6"></a>Uber</h3>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Uber is the first choice for people around the world when they think of moving people and making deliveries. It uses the personal data of the user to closely monitor which features of the service are mostly used, to analyze usage patterns and to determine where the services should be more focused. Uber focuses on the supply and demand of the services due to which the prices of the services provided changes. Therefore one of Uber’s biggest uses of data is surge pricing. For instance, if you are running late for an appointment and you book a cab in a crowded place then you must be ready to pay twice the amount.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">For example, On New Year’s Eve, the price for driving for one mile can go from 200 to 1000. In the short term, surge pricing affects the rate of demand, while long term use could be the key to retaining or losing customers. <strong><em>Machine learning algorithms</em></strong> are considered to determine where the demand is strong.</p>
          <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=12 data-line-end=13 ><a id="Netflix_12"></a>Netflix</h3>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">It is the most loved American entertainment company specializing in online on-demand streaming video for its customers. Netflix has been determined to be able to predict what exactly its customers will enjoy watching with Big Data. As such, Big Data analytics is the fuel that fires the ‘recommendation engine’ designed to serve this purpose. More recently, Netflix started positioning itself as a content creator, not just a distribution method. Unsurprisingly, this strategy has been firmly driven by data. Netflix’s recommendation engines and new content decisions are fed by data points such as what titles customers watch, how often playback stopped, ratings are given, etc. The company’s data structure includes Hadoop, Hive and Pig with much other traditional business intelligence.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">Netflix shows us that knowing exactly what customers want is easy to understand if the companies just don’t go with the assumptions and make decisions based on Big Data.</p>
          <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=18 data-line-end=19 ><a id="Ebay_18"></a>Ebay</h3>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">A big technical challenge for eBay as a data-intensive business to exploit a system that can rapidly analyze and act on data as it arrives (streaming data). There are many rapidly evolving methods to support streaming data analysis. eBay is working with several tools including Apache Spark, Storm, Kafka. It allows the company’s data analysts to search for information tags that have been associated with the data (metadata) and make it consumable to as many people as possible with the right level of security and permissions (data governance). The company has been at the forefront of using big data solutions and actively contributes its knowledge back to the open-source community.</p>
          <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=22 data-line-end=23 ><a id="Dont_leave_unused_potential_22"></a>Don’t leave unused potential</h2>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25">In order to seize the opportunities and master the challenges of using Big Data, managers need sufficient information - from technical implementation to the availability of internal experts to the interpretation of analysis results for decision making.</p>
